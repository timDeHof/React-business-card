      <p>
      I have full-stack software development expertise and am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I worked as a mechanical design engineer for a product development and engineering business with expertise in fast prototyping/3D printing, low volume, and mass manufacturing.

I attempt to stay current on new technologies and best practices, and I am constantly on the lookout for new things to learn.
